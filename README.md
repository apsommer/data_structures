# Data Structures

The fundamental data structures of computer science are explored using Python. The runtime complexity of the solutions to six problem sets are analyzed and discussed, created as part of the [Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree by Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-nanodegree--nd256).
