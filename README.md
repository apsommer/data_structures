# Data Structures

The fundamental data structures of computer science are explored using Python. The runtime and space complexity of six algorithms are discussed, created as part of the [Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree by Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-nanodegree--nd256).
