# File Recursion

For this problem, the goal is to write code for finding all files under a directory (and all directories beneath it) that end with ".c"

Here is an example of a test directory listing:

```
./testdir
./testdir/subdir1
./testdir/subdir1/a.c
./testdir/subdir1/a.h
./testdir/subdir2
./testdir/subdir2/.gitkeep
./testdir/subdir3
./testdir/subdir3/subsubdir1
./testdir/subdir3/subsubdir1/b.c
./testdir/subdir3/subsubdir1/b.h
./testdir/subdir4
./testdir/subdir4/.gitkeep
./testdir/subdir5
./testdir/subdir5/a.c
./testdir/subdir5/a.h
./testdir/t1.c
./testdir/t1.h

```

Python's os module will be usefulâ€”in particular, you may want to use the following resources:

[os.path.isdir(path)](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/os.path.html#os.path.isdir)

[os.path.isfile(path)](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/os.path.html#os.path.isfile)

[os.listdir(directory)](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/os.html#os.listdir)

[os.path.join(...)](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/os.path.html#os.path.join)

Note: `os.walk()` is a handy Python method which can achieve this task very easily. However, for this problem you are not allowed to use `os.walk()`.

### Solution

problem_2.py

### Explanation

The data structure for this problem is explicitly defined in the problem statement: return a list. No other structures are necessary.

The time complexity is O(n), where n = number of items, both files and directories, in the passed input "path" directory. Since this is a recursive search algorithm through an unordered, unknown directory structure, the best, average, and worst cases are all the same at O(n). We need to search everything to check if the entity has the suffix of interest, there is no further optimization in this case.
